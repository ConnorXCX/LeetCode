# Rotate Image

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
