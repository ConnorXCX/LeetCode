# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing
subsequence**_. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
