# Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter.**

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.
