# Word Search II

Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where **adjacent cells** are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
