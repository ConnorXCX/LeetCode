# Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.
